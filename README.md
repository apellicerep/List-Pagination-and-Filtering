# List Pagination and Live Filtering with Vanilla Javascript

I enhanced the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once.

I used an important development principle known as "progressive enhancement". Which in this case basically just means I added JavaScript to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon the JavaScript that you are adding.

Given the html and css of a list of students using Vanilla Javascript:

* I break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. And programmitcally add buttons to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 studnets at a time.
* I added a live filtering to the web.
* The code will work for any list conaining any number of items.
